### What is it?
An Android application to access the What The.....? Blog [chall32.blogspot.com]

### Why?
Well, it's quite simple really, I want to learn how to:

 1. Code in Java
 2. Use the Eclipse IDE
 3. Develop mobile applications
 4. Use Github for source code sharing

Sure, it's re-inventing the wheel, but hey, the best way to learn is by doing.
